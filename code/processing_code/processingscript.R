### Remove all variables that have Score or Total or FluA or FluB or Dxname or Activity in their name. 
## I initially tried to use grepl to remove variables by substring. This led me to remembering I can just use "-contains"
rawdata1 <- rawdata %>% select(-contains("Score"))
rawdata1 <- rawdata1 %>% select(-contains("Total"))
rawdata1 <- rawdata1 %>% select(-contains("FluA"))
rawdata1 <- rawdata1 %>% select(-contains("FluB"))
rawdata1 <- rawdata1 %>% select(-contains("Dxname"))
rawdata1 <- rawdata1 %>% select(-contains("Activity"))

### Also remove the variable Unique.Visit. 
rawdata1 <- rawdata1 %>% select(-Unique.Visit)

### A few have multiple categories. Remove any NA observations, there arenâ€™t many.
rawdata2 <- drop_na(rawdata1)

# location to save file
save_data_location <- here::here("data","processed_data","processeddata.rds")

saveRDS(rawdata2, file = save_data_location)
