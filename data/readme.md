Data in raw_data folder comes from https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.51c59zw4v. After downloading data from this site, I had to load it with read_rds(), even though it shows an .rda file extension. This dataset was processed in ~/code/processing_code/processingscript.R. Output is saved in ~/data/processed_data/processeddata.rds.

Processed data is used for analysis in the exploration.Rmd file and model_fitting.Rmd file.
